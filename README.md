🌱 EcoCycle – Turning Waste into Opportunity

EcoCycle is a smart upcycling marketplace designed to transform waste into valuable resources. The platform promotes a circular economy by connecting waste suppliers, artisans, eco-entrepreneurs, and environmentally conscious consumers in one centralized digital ecosystem.

📖 About the Project

Every year, billions of tons of reusable materials such as plastics, textiles, electronics, and wood end up in landfills and oceans. At the same time, artisans and sustainable businesses struggle to source quality materials, and consumers lack access to verified eco-friendly products.

EcoCycle solves this gap by enabling waste reuse, supporting sustainable creators, and tracking real environmental impact.

❗ Problems Addressed

Excessive Waste Generation
Large amounts of reusable materials are discarded, increasing pollution and landfill overflow.

Material Sourcing Challenges
Artisans and eco-entrepreneurs lack reliable access to reusable materials.

Limited Sustainable Product Access
Consumers face fragmented markets with little impact transparency.

No Environmental Impact Visibility
Individuals and businesses cannot easily track waste reduction or carbon savings.
